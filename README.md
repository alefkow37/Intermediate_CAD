# Intermediate_CAD
My Intermediate_CAD assignments 

In these assignments we created the Design Tables and the Advanced and Mechanical Mates. Neither of these assignments were difficult 
The Design Table was an assignment that re-introduced us to CAD. It was a pretty straight forward assignment and didn't take long too complete. We were told to make a "spool looking thing". Once we had made the basic design, we had to add holes and make six new configurations, using a Design Table. This part was a bit tricky but I caught on quickly. The result was 6 different sizes of the same thing. 

The Advanced and Mechanical Mates assignment showed me how to use advanced mates. This was a pretty easy assignment. The only part I struggled with was getting the configurations right.
